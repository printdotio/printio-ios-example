believe in good faith that any material used or displayed on or

send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access
to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a)
a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on
behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have
been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a

if you opt-out or for disputes relating to your or SparkMode's
intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names,
trade secrets, copyrights and patents) (&quot;<B>Excluded Disputes</B>&quot;),
you agree that all disputes between you and SparkMode (whether or not
such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship
with SparkMode, including without limitation disputes related to
these Terms, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or
publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under
the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of
consumer-related disputes and you and SparkMode hereby expressly
waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in
your local &quot;small claims&quot; court, if permitted by that small
claims court's rules.  You may bring claims only on your own behalf.
You agree that neither you nor SparkMode will participate in a class
action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these
Terms. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a
private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated
claims involving another person's account, if SparkMode is a party to
the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by
the Federal Arbitration Act.  In the event the American Arbitration
Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one
hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either
SparkMode or you can elect to have the arbitration administered
instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services.  Judgment
on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law
notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award
damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms.</P>
